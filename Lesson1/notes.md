| Feature / Pattern               | üß± **Simple Factory**                          | üè≠ **Factory Method**                                  | üè¢ **Abstract Factory**                                                    |

| **Definition**                  | A static method returns objects based on input | A base class defines a method, subclasses implement it | Provides interface to create **families of related objects**               |
| **Design Pattern Type**         | Common (not part of GoF patterns)              | GoF Creational                                         | GoF Creational                                                             |
| **Main Purpose**                | Centralize simple object creation              | Allow subclasses to choose which class to instantiate  | Create groups of related objects without specifying concrete classes       |
| **Object Type Handling**        | Creates one of many possible classes           | Creates one object per class hierarchy                 | Creates **multiple** related objects (e.g., buttons, checkboxes)           |
| **New Type Addition**           | Modify the factory method                      | Add a new subclass                                     | Add a new factory subclass                                                 |
| **Flexibility / Extensibility** | Low                                            | Medium                                                 | High                                                                       |
| **Client Code Dependency**      | Dependent on factory and product classes       | Independent of concrete product classes                | Independent of all concrete products and families                          |
| **Open/Closed Principle**       | Violates (modifies factory for new types)      | Respects (extend via subclass)                         | Respects (extend factory family)                                           |
| **Example in C++**              | `PizzaFactory::createPizza("cheese")`          | `RoadLogistics::createTransport()` returns `Truck`     | `WindowsFactory::createButton()` and `createCheckbox()`                    |
| **Analogy**                     | Order a pizza by name                          | Logistics app decides truck/ship based on subclass     | UI toolkit switches entire theme (Windows/Mac)                             |
| **Use Case**                    | Simple, one-off object creation logic          | Varying object creation per subclass logic             | Need to switch between entire sets of related products (themes, platforms) |
